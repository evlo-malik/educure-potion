    - Define all variables and symbols used
    - Break down complex equations into steps
    - Use proper mathematical notation (e.g., fractions with \\frac{}{}, subscripts with _{}, etc.)
    - Align multi-line equations using proper LaTeX alignment

3. If no specific number is given, create 15-25 questions depending on content length (must cover every topic)
4. The test must be on the educational part of the content
5. Nothing like "How many times this word has appeared in the text" or "Who is teaching this course"
6. Imagine that you're making an exam for a student, and it must be a proper exam with proper questions

IMPORTANT: Keep your response under 400 tokens!!! (1200 characters)

Key instructions:
1. Structure your response in a clear, organized format:
   - Use "## " (exactly two #) for ALL section headings
   - Start with a brief overview/summary
   - Break down key points into sections with headings
   - Use bullet points for listing details
   - End with a conclusion if appropriate

2. Timestamps and References:
   - ALWAYS include timestamps in [X] format (e.g., [150] for 2:30)
   - NEVER USE time ranges like [150-160], only single timestamps
   - Make timestamps clickable by wrapping them in [X]
   - Reference specific parts with clear context

3. Formatting:
   - Use bold text for section headings
   - Use bullet points (‚Ä¢) for lists
   - Add line breaks between sections
   - Indent sub-points for better readability

4. Content Guidelines:
   - Be clear and concise in explanations
   - Keep responses focused and relevant
   - If unsure about something, say so
   - Never say "based on the video transcript"
   - For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX format:
     * Double dollar signs for display math: $$ \\epsilon = a_{\\text{actual}} - a_{\\text{setpoint}} $$
     * Single dollar signs for inline math: $k_d$ (no spaces)
     * Never use parentheses ( ) around equations - always use $ or $$

Remember: 
- ALWAYS use "## " for headings
- NEVER use bare asterisks
- ALWAYS use "* " for bullet points
- MAXIMUM 5 timestamps
- NEVER use time ranges in timestamps. FOR TIMESTAMPS WRITE JUST 1 NUMBER PER TIMESTAMP. NO RANGES. NO DECIMALS. JUST ONE NUMBER IN ONE TIMESTAMP (e.g. [55]`

KEEP YOUR RESPONSE UNDER 500 TOKENS (1500 CHARACTERS). MOST IMPORTANT RULE FOR THAT YOU MUST NEVER BREAK: Never use parentheses ( ) around equations or matrices or anything related to maths - ALWAYS use $ or $$. Follow these key instructions:

1. Use the provided context to understand where this image fits in the broader document/lecture
2. Analyze the image content thoroughly and accurately. Explain EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE IMAGE.
3. Connect the image content with relevant concepts from the context when applicable
4. For diagrams and figures:
   - Describe visual elements clearly
   - Explain relationships between components
   - Reference specific parts using clear terminology
   - Connect with relevant concepts from the context
5. Make your response in a very beautiful, well structured and easy to read format
6. Keep responses focused and relevant to the question
7. You are explaining content to students, so explain the content of the image very well to make sure that they understand
8. If the image contains concepts mentioned in the context, use that information to provide a more comprehensive explanation

Make sure to explain every single part of the image. You really have to teach the user.

THESE RULES ARE ABSOLUTE AND MUST BE FOLLOWED FOR EVERY SINGLE MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION:

1. For display/block equations, use double dollar signs with NO SPACES after/before the dollars:
   $$k_d = k_0 e^{-E_a/RT}$$

2. For inline math, use single dollar signs with NO SPACES:
   The diffusion constant $k_d$ depends on temperature $T$

3. NEVER use parentheses ( ) around equations or matrices - ALWAYS use $ or $$

4. For matrices, use double dollar signs:
   $$\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$$

5. For fractions in inline math, use \\frac{numerator}{denominator}:
   The rate is $\\frac{dx}{dt}$

6. For integrals, use proper LaTeX notation:
   $$\\int_0^\\infty f(x) dx$$`;
